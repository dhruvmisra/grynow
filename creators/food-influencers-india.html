						</li>
						<li>
							<h3>Followers </h3>
							<p>Today social media is such a powerful platform that one negative comment or a positive review from a person you do not know can influence your decision to give the product or the service a miss or a try. And foodie influencers are people who have their own set of followers – their word is more heard than probably even a celebrity or a public figure. There is a reason to this – when coming straight from these bloggers and vloggers people immediately connect with it because they appear more realistic and natural than a film star or a wealthy sportsperson. </p>
						</li>
						<li>

					</ul>

                    <h2>What does a food blogger do? </h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Videos / Posts</h3>
                            <p>These are people, not necessarily chefs and trained people, who post about cooking, ingredients, styles, cuisines – they write posts and upload videos and pictures of the delicacies. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h3>Satisfaction</h3>
                            <p>These are people like you and me and yet by virtue of their knowledge, skill or the mere fact that they can offer satisfying suggestions to others, they are famous and have their own set of followers who vouch for their words. </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>

So much so that they can instantly connect with an audience and sway them with their words and ideas - imagine what they can do when it comes to be the spokesperson for your brand! </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The concept of food influencer marketing has evolved from this very parenthesis that when the right and the top food influencers are chosen to speak to your target market or when an influencer’s follower’s overlap with your desired audience, your brand image can be solidified and strengthened further. </p>
