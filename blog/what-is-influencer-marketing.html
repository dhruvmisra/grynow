        <h2>How Influencer marketing is the next phase of marketing for brands</h2>
        <h3>Increase in Sales</h3>
        <p>Brands just want a way for flourishing their businesses, and influencer marketing is a unique way for brands to have great awareness, leads, ROI and ultimately sales within very short time.</p>
        <h3>Trust & Relationship</h3>
        <p>Brands use the power of influencers to market their product / service by collaborating with content creators. With influencer marketing, brands build a more trustful relationship with their potential customers and hence can sell their product / service quickly by a direct engagement.</p>

        <h2>How Influencer marketing is way superior to other forms of marketing?</h2>
        <h3>Connection</h3>
        <p>People like to listen to people and not from machines / robots as we all are human beings. Through influencer marketing, brands can directly connect with the people who are their target audience instantly through influencers. And, we as emotional human beings are more biased towards the things which our leader use or say that is worthy. </p>

        <h2>Finding value for your company through influencers</h2>
        <p>Brands should be very careful in choosing this form of marketing to be effective. Let us explore the things to evaluate and research as a brand before leveraging the power of influencer marketing in India:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h3>Expertise </h3>
            <p>Does the influencer have the authority level knowledge in his / her niche industry?</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Reach </h3>
            <p>Analyze the previous reach of creator’s content </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Demographics</h3>
            <p>Does your buyer persona match correctly with this influencer / creator’s followers demographics</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Platform </h3>
            <p>Are your buyer persona present on that platform i.e. Facebook or Youtube or Instagram or Tik tok that the influencer is capable of targeting or your target audience is still not on any platform</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Form of Content </h3>
            <p>What form of content your potential customers want to consume – whether video or text or any other form</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>What not to do through influencers?</h2>
        <p>As influencers are brands themselves, they have built their own brand name by extreme hard work and have spent enough time in building it in influencing their followers in a specific industry and also cultivating them regularly so it is not the case that any brand can approach any influencer and can convince him /  her to say great things about the brand.
            So the brands should be crystal clear in their approach about connecting with the specific influencer of the influencer marketing agency for the promotion / branding.
