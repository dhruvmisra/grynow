					<h2>What is influencer marketing?</h2>
					<p>Influencer marketing is growing at an incomparable speed in the domain of customer acquisition. We are all aware of celebrity endorsements. Traditionally film stars, sportsmen and sportswomen and other such popular figures have been involved in advertising or endorsing a brand and a product. This form of marketing has always worked wonders because as a common feature, human beings tend to trust when a famous personality voices his or her opinion. In the modern digital world, the endorsement of products and services has stretched further to enter the domain of the virtual world. 
							Influencer marketing brand is a marketing tool that uses the power or the talent of online content creators to engage with their audience around a brand, its product or services. An influencer is someone who is an active social media user with a large following in the digital world. This person can be a common man or even a popular figure but the criterion to decide whether he is an influencer or not is the number of followers that he has which could vary from few  hundred to few millions. Influencer marketing owes its birth to the fact that followers of an influencer generally believe what he or she says in context of a brand, a product or a service. Such followers decide to buy or use a product or service or even a brand based on the suggestion given by the influencer. And since the influencers can be anyone and anywhere, they are so believable and people connect with trust and faith without doubting the intentions.
